subsurface scattering
better shadows
dither diffuse map like in gta
voxel cone tracing global illumination
make sure GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT is used for elements of models that can use it.
make tangent exports only for needed for objects with their material using normal maps
light prepass doesn't need the invProj multiplication. make it like ssao
PBR
batch lights for prepass
transparent objects
optimize texture sizes.
texture atlases to combine draw calls.
water ez copy
motion blur
octree ez just copy from other project
BSP
portal culling
editor
fix compression 
fix seg fault on > MAX_MATERIALS
BoneUpdate only needs to accumulate the rotation if there are springs in the skeleton, make it check.
ragdolls
physics
clean up renderer.c
remember stencils half done
remember i removed the halfres
textureless exports
modelViewInvTranspose in all needed
yet another passthrough for shadows, using the normal passthrough is a waste
modelViewInvTranspose probably not working for skinned passthroughs with normalmaps
view can be a mat3 not a mat4 for normals
		kernel[k].z = -((rand() % 1000) / 1000.0f);
